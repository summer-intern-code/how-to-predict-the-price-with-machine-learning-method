# How to predict the price with machine learning method
## Introduction
#### This part contains code related to predicting the price in a rolling basis and feature optimization engneering.
## Main method
#### Linear/Quadratic/Cubic regression (price-volume(cubic.py))(price(2regression.py))
###### Closed form method for regression(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guestrin/Class/10701-S06/Handouts/recitations/recitation-linear-regression-01-26-2006.pdf)
#### SVM (price only)
#### Random Forest Model (price only)
#### RNN/LSTM/GR
#### HMM(Looking for hidden state to define bear/bull market
